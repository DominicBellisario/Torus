While traveling through the depths of space, the Torus received a distress signal from a nearby freight ship and went to investigate.  They flew as fast as they could but arrived to see the freight ship destroyed, and a swarm of evil shapes staring hungrily in their direction.  do you have what it takes to survive until help arrives?

the Torus faces the mouse and can accelerate in the 8 carndinal directions.  You can fire in one direction and move in another.
Two different enemies.  The Circle drifts across the screen, and the Diamond spins around while shooting lasers out of its four corners.
The player fires out of two cannons, and alternates from one to another with each shot fired.
Each wave spawns a random amount of enemies. The enemies spawn in random points around the edge of the screen with random speeds and rotations. More Circles are spawned than Diamonds.
Particle effects representing thrusters turn on When the Torus accelerates.
Left-clicking fires one bullet.  Click faster to shoot faster.
